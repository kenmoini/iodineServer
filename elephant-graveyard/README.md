# Elephant Graveyard

This is a collection of scripts that sort of work, or had parts of features implemented but not fully debugged/tested.  It's just too hard for me to delete anything...

These files are not related to the main functions of the Iodine Server.  They're placeholders in case anyone else can come in and help me figure out why Python 3 is complaining about some stderr invalid I/O buffer.
